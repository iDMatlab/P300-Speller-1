# P300-Speller
P300 Speller is an application that allows us spell words and display them on the screen by using only the power of thoughts. It uses visual stimulation, meaning that when we focus on specific visual stimuli, our brain produces specific patterns. Those patterns last around 300ms after presentation. This phenomenon is called P300. The application itself represents a matrix that consists of letters and numbers. Rows and columns are consecutively highlighted with the interval of 100ms each. The subject is nicely asked to focus his attention on just one letter, and once the desired letter is highlighted the signal goes through the occipital lobe. EEG cap captures that activity and sends it to computer. Then classification algorithm is used to choose the correct result. Once itâ€™s done, the letter subject was focusing on appears on the screen. And so the process is repeated, letter by letter, until the whole word is formed.
